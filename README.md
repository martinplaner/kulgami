Game board generator for the [Kulami](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108831/kulami) board game based on genetic algorithms.

NOTE: Proof of concept, pretty inefficient and far from beautiful code. Created as a quick-and-dirty weekend project some time ago. Just putting it on GitHub if someone is interested.

## Usage

- `go get github.com/martinplaner/kulgami`
- `go install` or `go build`
- Run with `./kulgami`, wait a while until finished. Board is rendered to "board.png" and should be automatically opened in default image viewer.
